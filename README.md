# enact-dev-dist

This repository exists to tag flat full distributions of enact-cli, self-containing NodeJS binaries, and NPM.

It is intended to be updated directly from enact-cli, so no devlopment should occur here. This is a temporary repository, serving to supply enact-cli into the webOS build tools and is not intended for general use.

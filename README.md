**Not for general usage. Developers should use [@enact/cli](https://github.com/enactjs/cli) instead.**

This repository exists to tag flat full distributions of enact-cli, self-containing NodeJS binaries, and NPM. It is intended to be updated periodically from @enact/cli, so no devlopment should occur here. This is a temporary repository, serving to supply @enact/cli into the webOS build tools and is not intended for general use.
